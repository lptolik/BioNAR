\title{BioNAR: Biological Network Analysis in R}
\description{
The R package BioNAR, developed to step by step analysis of PPI
network. The aim is to quantify and rank each proteinâ€™s simultaneous
impact into multiple complexes based on network topology and
clustering. Package also enables estimating of co-occurrence of
diseases across the network and specific clusters pointing towards
shared/common mechanisms.
