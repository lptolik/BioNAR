Description: the R package BioNAR, developed to step by step analysis of PPI 
            network. The aim is to quantify and rank each protein’s simultaneous 
            impact into multiple complexes based on network topology and 
            clustering. Package also enables estimating of co-occurrence of 
            diseases across the network and specific clusters pointing towards 
            shared/common mechanisms.
