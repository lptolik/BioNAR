# BioNAR 1.3

* Take into account edge weights in clustering algorithms and centrality measure
  calculations.
* Add calculation of the DYNAMO perturbation pattern from signed weight directed
  networks proposed in Santolini,M. and Barabasi,A.-L. (2018) PNAS 169, 201720589
* Decoupled from synaptome.db and synaptome.data packages. All code, related
  to graph building from the synaptome.db data is moved to synaptome.db package.

# BioNAR 1.2.1

* Allow analysis of directed graphs and add four new centrality measures specific 
  for the directed graphs.
* Modify annotation functions to allow annotate nodes not only by its name 
  propety but by any other arbitrary property if its value uniquely identify
  the node.
* Added new framework for the visualisation and analysis of enrichment results.

# BioNAR 0.99.001

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
